### How the Code Works

This script calculates the **Head Injury Criterion (HIC)** from acceleration data recorded over time. HIC is a critical measure used to evaluate head impact severity in fields like automotive safety and sports science. The script involves data preparation, filtering, and calculating HIC values iteratively over different time windows to find the maximum HIC value and its corresponding time range.

---

### Workflow Explanation

1. **Command-Line Arguments**  
   - The script takes arguments via the command line using `argparse`. These arguments define:
     - Sampling frequency of the data (`--frequency`).
     - Path to the CSV file containing acceleration data (`--file_path`).
     - Column indices for X, Y, and Z acceleration components (`--x_location`, `--y_location`, `--z_location`).

   Example:
   ```bash
   python hic_calculator.py --frequency 0.00001 --file_path "data.csv" --x_location 2 --y_location 3 --z_location 4
   ```

---

2. **Initialize `HICCalculator`**  
   - An instance of the `HICCalculator` class is created using the provided frequency. [1]
   - Default values for the Butterworth low-pass filter are also initialized (`cutoff = 1650 Hz`, `order = 2`). [2]

---

3. **Read and Process the Data**  
   - The script reads the CSV file from the provided file path.  
   - It calculates the magnitude of acceleration for each timestamp using the formula:
     \[
     \text{magnitude} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} / 9810
     \]
     The division by `9810` converts the magnitude to G-forces.  
   - The raw magnitude data is passed through a Butterworth low-pass filter to remove noise and high-frequency components.

   **Key Operations in This Step**:
   - **Time Calculation**: The time for each row is calculated based on the sampling frequency.  
     Example: `time = row_index * frequency`.
   - **Filtering**: The magnitudes are filtered using the `scipy.signal.butter` and `scipy.signal.lfilter` functions.

---

4. **Iterative HIC Calculation**  
   - The script calculates HIC for various time windows. It starts with a window size equal to the sampling frequency and iterates up to `15 ms`.  
   - For each window, the HIC value is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     HIC = \left(\frac{1}{t_2 - t_1} \int_{t_1}^{t_2} a(t) \, dt \right)^{2.5} (t_2 - t_1)
     \]
     where \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \) are the start and end times of the window, and \( a(t) \) is the filtered acceleration magnitude.

   **Steps**:
   - Calculate the integral of acceleration over the window.
   - Compute the HIC value for the current window.
   - Store the HIC value and the time window in a dictionary.

---

5. **Find Maximum HIC**  
   - After iterating through all possible time windows up to `15 ms`, the script determines the maximum HIC value and the corresponding time window.

---

6. **Output the Results**  
   - The maximum HIC value and its time range are printed to the console:
     ```
     The HIC 15 value is <max_hic_value> and was achieved between the time window of <max_hic_window>.
     ```

### Example Workflow

**Input CSV** (Sample rows):
```csv
X,Y,Z
0.1,0.2,0.3
0.15,0.25,0.35
0.2,0.3,0.4
...
```

**Steps**:
1. User specifies the file path and column indices for X, Y, Z.  
2. The script computes time and acceleration magnitude for each row.
3. Magnitudes are filtered using a low-pass filter.
4. HIC is calculated for multiple overlapping time windows.
5. The script outputs the maximum HIC value and the time window.

**Output Example**:
```
The HIC 15 value is 123.45 and was achieved between the time window of 0.05:0.07.
```
