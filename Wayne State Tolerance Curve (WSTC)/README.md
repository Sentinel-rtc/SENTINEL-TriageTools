## Background
The Wayne State Tolerance Curve (WSTC), developed in 1966, is the inaugural injury criterion for human head. It delineates the correlation between linear acceleration, its duration, and the likelihood of head injury. According to the WSTC, the human head can endure exceptionally high acceleration for brief duration without incurring injury. Conversely, prolonged exposure to the same acceleration levels would lead to injury. While the WSTC marked the first criterion to distinguish between safe and unsafe acceleration levels, it has faced criticism for its inability to scale injuries (Gurdjian et al., 1966).
