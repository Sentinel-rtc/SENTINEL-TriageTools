# SENTINEL-TriageTools
An open-source repository for scripts and algorithms to assess pedestrian head injuries at the roadside. Part of the SENTINEL project, it supports developing mobile triage tools for emergency services, improving accuracy, speed, and outcomes in brain injury assessments for adult pedestrians (16+).

## Stage 1
This stage involves comparinging injuries criteria for estimating head injruies. All 22 injuries criteria for head avaiable in literature will be implemented in python and compared objectivly for their predictive performance. 
1. Wayne State Tolerance Curve (WSTC)
2. Severity Index (SI)
3. Effective Displacement Index (EDI)
4. Head Injury Criterion (HIC)
5. Generalized Acceleration Model for Brain Injury Threshold (GAMBIT)
6. Maximum Principal Strain (MPS)
7. Head Impact Power (HIP)
