Effective Displacement Index (EDI), introduced in 1970. EDI is based on a simple mass-spring-damper model of the human head and is defined as the ratio of maximum head displacement to 38.1 mm (anterior-posterior) or 45.72 mm (resultant displacement). A value of EDI < 1 is associated with concussion, while EDI > 1 is considered hazardous (Brinn & Staffeld, 1970).
